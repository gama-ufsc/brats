# brats

Useful functions and pipelines for brain tumor segmentation.

## Install instructions

For now, the only tested method is
```
python setup.py develop
```

Note that this won't _actually_ install the package, but make you able to import it as any other installed package. This means that any changes to the code will reflect immediately in any "dependee".
